                <p class="par-1 mainpar"><strong>The Early Days:</strong> I was born in April of 2001 <em>G.C</em>, in a small town called Hawassa. I lived there all my life but moved to Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, in 2014. I attended and graduated high school from school tomorrow and now, I am currently enrolled and attending collage at Addis Ababa University (AAU). So, in addition to being a food enthusiast I am also an aspiring creative designer and web developer with a focus on frontend technologies.</p>

                    <p class="b">I am also extremely family oriented. My family is everything to me and I cherish my interactions and affections with them more than anything in this world.
