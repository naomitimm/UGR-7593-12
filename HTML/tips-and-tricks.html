                        <span class="bold"> 1. Invest in a silicone baking mat.</span><br>
                        Not only does it save your pans, but it cuts cleaning time in half and I personally think that the mat makes the cookies bake much more evenly.<br>
                        <span class="bold"> 2. Take your cookies out when just the edges have hardened.</span><br>
                        If you wait for them to 'cook all the way through' then they'll break your teeth!<br>
                        <span class="bold"> 3. Coat things like fruit and chocolate chips in flour before adding them to your mix.</span><br>
                        This prevents all the bits from sinking to the bottom and ensures you’ve got an even distribution of flavour.<br>
                        <span class="bold">4. Use an ice cream scoop to portion your muffins and cupcakes. </span><br>
                        When I make muffins or cupcakes, I use a small ice cream scoop to fill the liners. It gives me perfect proportions every time. <br>
                        <span class="bold"> 5. Swap vanilla extract for vanilla bean paste.</span><br> The flavour is more similar to using a real vanilla bean, and you get those little black vanilla seeds as proof of how fancy you and your cake/frosting/whatever you’re making is.

                    <p class="tiptrick">
                        <span class="bold"> 1. Chop ingredients uniformly.</span> <br>
                        Remember: If it looks the same, it cooks the same. When prepping, slice ingredients so they're all about the same size. This ensures everything cooks evenly and consistently — and lets you avoid overdone smaller pieces, and still-raw larger ones.<br>
                        
                        <span class="bold"> 2. Don't add ingredients to a pan until the oil is hot enough.</span> <br>
                        If the oil isn't ready, food will soak it up instead of sizzling in it — and the end result won't taste as good. You want oil hot enough so that it swirls or ripples when you move the pan, but not so hot that it smokes. Learn more about how to spot the difference here.<br>
                        
                        <span class="bold">3. For the best sear, dry meat off with a paper towel first. </span> <br>
                        Meat can carry a layer of moisture on the outside, so it's important to get rid of that if you want the sharpest sear when the protein hits the pan. The quickest way? Dry it with a paper towel.<br>
                        
                        <span class="bold"> 4. When working with aromatics, add garlic last.</span> <br>
                        Because garlic burns easily, many recipes tell you to add it last, and that's a great blanket rule — especially if it's minced or chopped.<br>
                        
                        
                        <span class="bold">5. Clean as you go!  </span> <br>
                        
                        Plant a scrap bowl right on the counter so you don't have to sidetrack to the trash, and load dirty plates straight into the washer instead of stacking them in the sink. Keeping things neat makes the cooking process easier — and cuts down on cleanup afterwards.<br></p>

                        <span class="bold">1. Cook grilled cheese with mayonnaise for the crispiest sandwich ever.</span></br>

                        Everyone has heard of making grilled cheese with butter. But the buzz on Pinterest is that frying grilled cheese in mayo makes the bread crispier and more delicious. Even Martha Stewart swears by this trick.</br>


                        <span class="bold">2. Add soy sauce to popcorn butter to make it even better.</span></br>
                        Everyone knows butter on popcorn is delicious. (Right? Right.) But supposedly adding some soy sauce to popcorn butter makes for a next-level popcorn topper. The addition of salty soy sauce to creamy butter brings out the savoury, cheesy, and nutty flavours in popcorn.</br>



                        <span class="bold">3. Add coffee to brownie batter to enhance the taste of the chocolate.</span><br>
                        I always thought baking brownies was a relatively simple affair. For a novice baker like me who often opts for the boxed stuff, I never put too much thought into it. But websites like Bon Appétit and The Kitchn both mention how adding a pour of brewed coffee to brownie batter takes the desert to the next level.</br>


                        <span class="bold">4. Boil spaghetti in water and add baking soda to give it a ramen-like texture.</span></br>
                        I am a huge ramen fan — especially the kind you order in a restaurant, drowning in soy sauce and chicken broth and garnished with soft egg and bok choy. With this trick you can magically turn your run-of-the-mill spaghetti into bouncy, cloying noodles that make for an A+ bowl of homemade ramen. </br>


                        <span class="bold">5. Add mustard to mac 'n' cheese to balance out the flavours perfectly.</span></br>
                        It's difficult to make bad mac 'n' cheese (macaroni + butter + flour + cheese = everything that's good in this world). But if you ask me, making exceptional mac 'n' cheese is a form of art.But mustard takes it to the next level."</br>

                    <p class="tiptrick"><span class="bold">1. Store lemons in the fridge, not on countertops.</span></br>

                        In a test, lemons stored in sealed plastic bags in the fridge lasted four times longer than lemons kept at room temperature.</br>
                        <span class="bold">2. Take cheese out of the plastic wrap it came in.</span></br>
                        
                        Instead, re-wrap it in parchment paper or cheese paper so it can breathe and last longer. When cheese is wrapped in plastic, it can't intake oxygen — which can affect flavour and breed bacteria.</br>
                        <span class="bold">3. Store refrigerated greens with a paper towel.
                        </span></br>
                        The paper towel absorbs excess moisture, which keeps the greens from getting soggy over time — and extends their shelf-life.</br>
                        <span class="bold">4. Freeze about-to-wilt herbs in olive oil.
                        </span></br>
                        
                        Then use them as ready-made recipe starters in dishes that call for oil as the first step — like stews, soups, or roasts.</br>
                        <span class="bold">5. Or freeze the leftovers from a half-empty box of broth or stock.
                        </span></br>
                        Portion them out into ice cube trays, then drop into recipes that call for a bit of liquid to add flavour at the end, like pasta sauces.
